# noinstagram

I got rid of my IG account some time ago, but I'd still like to see [photos from my wife](https://instagram.com/juiskie/) and [our dog](https://instagram.com/scooterpablovance/). I was just visiting the IG website for each public user I wanted to view, but that was way too much work. So I [built this](https://datvance.github.io/noinstagram/) one Sunday.

## Want your own noinstagram page?

- thanks to [instagram-php-scraper](https://github.com/postaddictme/instagram-php-scraper) for the hard work
- theoretically, you can put #hashtags in accounts.json and it should pull those too, but there's [a bug in the scraper](https://github.com/postaddictme/instagram-php-scraper/issues/444)
- style and features are pretty basic, but hey, pull requests welcome
